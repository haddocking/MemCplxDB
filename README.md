## Introduction

Membrane protein complexes docking benchmark. This repository contains the
entries of the Membrane Protein docking benchmark (V1.0). It also contains
[ProFit](http://www.bioinf.org.uk/programs/profit/) analysis scripts for
the calculation of Interface- and Ligand-RMSD (I-/L-RMSD) values for all
the entries of the benchmark. We have generated docking decoys for all the
entries of the benchmark with the [HADDOCK](http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/)
webserver. In addition to I- and L-RMSDs we have calculated van der Waals,
Electrostatic and Desolvation energies and the Buried Surface Area (BSA)
for all decoys of all complexes.

## Repository Structure

The [structures](structures) folder contains all the structure files in PDB format. Both
reference (bound) and unbound structures are included. All structures have been
modified so that chain identifiers and residue numbering is consistent.

Every subfolder in the [structures](structures) folder (eg [1k4c](structures/1k4c)) contains
the following files:

* `*_bound.pdb` -> The reference structure for a given complex.
* `*_unbound_*.pdb`-> The unbound structures for a given complex.
* `*_unbound.pdb` -> The unbound structures optimally and independently superimposed on the reference chains.
* `*.irmsd` -> The backbond I-RMSD (in Å) of the unbound complex relative to the reference structure.
* `*.izone` -> [ProFit](http://www.bioinf.org.uk/programs/profit/)-compatible I-RMSD calculation script.
* `*.lzone` -> [ProFit](http://www.bioinf.org.uk/programs/profit/)-compatible L-RMSD calculation script.

The two subfolders in the [analysis](analysis) folder contain the results of the docking
runs for two docking scenarios. One using only random restraints to drive the docking
([random_restraints](analysis/random_restraints)) and one using restraints derived from
the interface of the bound complex ([true_interface](analysis/true_interface)). Both folders
contain 37 space-separated text files that are the results of the analysis of the docking
run of a given complex.

## Benchmark entries

The two tables below list the dimeric and trimeric entries respectively. The second column is the PDB
id of the bound complex, the second and third (second through fourth for the trimeric table) list the
origin of the unbound structures for that complex. The complexes that appear more than once in the
benchmark are idenitified by the presence of an identifier in the complex_id field (eg 2r6g-TM).

The _Category_ column refers to the nature of the complex. MS stands for complexes whose interface lies
along the membrane-soluble region, TM stands for complexes whose interface lies within the membrane,
Both stands for complexes whose interface lies in both membrane and soluble regions, Buried stands for
complexes where one of the partners is buried in a transmembrane β-barrel and AB stands for complexes
where one of the partners is an antibody-like domain.

The _Composition_ column refers to the origin of the unbound structures of a complex. BB stands for
Bound-Bound and means all partners have been extracted from the bound complex, UB stands for Bound-Unbound
and means at least one of the partners has been extracted from an alternative structure and UU stands
for Unbound-Unbound and means none of the partners originate in the bound complex.

The _Difficulty_ column reflects the difficulty of a given complex with Bound cases having an I-RMSD
of 0, Easy cases having an I-RMSD between 0 and 1Å, Intermediate cases having an I-RMSD between 1 and 2Å
and Hard cases having an I-RMSD greater than 2Å.

## Analysis

All the RMSD values have been calculated with [ProFit](http://www.bioinf.org.uk/programs/profit/) and
all energy values along with Surface area by [HADDOCK](http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/).

The following is an example of the results of the analysis for dimeric complex.

### HADDOCK terms

The values that have been calculated with HADDOCK are the Eair, Evdw, Eelec, Edesolv and BSA terms.
HS stands for HADDOCK-SCORE which is a weighted sum of the pervious terms. Eair refers to the
restraint energy, Evdw and Eelec are the non-bonded terms and are calculated with the OPLS force
field, Edesolv stands for desolvation energy and BSA stands for Buried Surface Area.

The terms that are related to HADDOCK but are not included in the scoring of complexes are stage,
and rank. Stage refers to one of three stages of a HADDOCK run:

* it0 - Rigid-body energy minisation
* it1 - Simulated annealing in torsional space
* itw - Flexible refinement in explicit solvent

Rank refers to the ranking of that particular structure by the HADDOCK scoring function.

### RMSD terms

The two RMSD terms are i-RMSD and l-RMSD. They stand for interface and ligand RMSD respectively. For
the I-RMSD calculation we have calculated the RMSD of the backbone atoms of the interface. The interface
is defined as the set of residues whose atoms are within 10Å of any atom of a partner. For the L-RMSD
calculation we have superimposed the receptors (defined as the biggest partner) using all backbone atoms
and calculated the displacement of the backbone atoms of the ligand (defined as the smallest partner).
For the trimers, we have calculated the displacement of both partners (with regards to the first) and
report their mean and standard deviation.

### ProFit Instructions

Those interested in reproducing the RMSD calculations can do so with the following ProFit commands

Using complex `1m56` as an example.

For the I-RMSD calculations:

`profit -f AB.izone 1m56_bound.pdb 1m56_unbound.pdb`

If ProFit is correctly installed on your system you should see the following output:

The line starting with RMS contains the I-RMSD value.

For the L-RMSD calculations:

`profit -f AB.lzone 1m56_bound.pdb 1m56_unbound.pdb`

Which should print:

                  PPPPP                FFFFFF ii   tt
                  PP  PP               FF          tt

In this case two RMSD values are calculated and printed to the terminal. The first is the RMSD
of the backbone atoms of the receptor (in this case chain A). The second is the L-RMSD value.
In this case it is 0 as chain B has been extracted from the bound complex for case `1m56`.
